# code_strategy

// Go to your terminal/the location you plan to run this python script on


Windows: 
pip install PyQt5 qdarkstyle

MacOS:
pip3 install PyQt5 qdarkstyle

Linux:
pip3 install PyQt5 qdarkstyle


If you encounter any issues with linux, I reccomend using a venv (virtual environment) dedicated to that specific script
The same can be done on macOS or Windows althought it usually isn't as big of an issue. (some code editors automatically create a venv already)

! Make sure u have pip installed and python updated to the latest version

Unzip the code_strategy file, take that new unfipped file to the location you want to run the script from.


Ether open a code editor or go to your terminal
Navigate to that file:


Terminal : cd path/to/code_strategy
         : python3 main.py #MACOS/LINUX
         : python main.py #WINDOWS

VScode   : Open folder -> Navigate to main.py within the directory -> Press 'run script' button at the top right.

Delete any files left during the install like any .ZIP files or this README file if you've successfully ran the main.py script
