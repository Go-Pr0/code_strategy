# code_strategy

## Go to your terminal/the location you plan to run this python script on


Windows: 
pip install PyQt5 qdarkstyle

MacOS:
pip3 install PyQt5 qdarkstyle

Linux:
pip3 install PyQt5 qdarkstyle


If you encounter any issues with linux, I reccomend using a venv (virtual environment) dedicated to that specific script <br>
The same can be done on macOS or Windows althought it usually isn't as big of an issue. (some code editors automatically create a venv already) <br>

! Make sure u have pip installed and python updated to the latest version

--

Unzip the code_strategy file, take that new unfipped file to the location you want to run the script from.


Ether open a code editor or go to your terminal
Navigate to that file:

>Terminal <br><br>
> cd path/to/code_strategy<br><br>
> python3 main.py #MACOS/LINUX<br><br>
> python main.py #WINDOWS <br><br>

>VScode: <br><br>
>Open folder <br><br>
>-> Navigate to main.py within the directory <br><br>
>-> Press 'run script' button at the top right.<br><br>
<br>
Delete any files left during the install like any .ZIP files or this README file if you've successfully ran the main.py script
